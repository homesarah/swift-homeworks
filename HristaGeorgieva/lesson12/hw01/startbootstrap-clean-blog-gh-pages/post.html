            <p>Thor: Ragnarok isn't just the best Thor movie. It's the most cosmic Marvel movie this side of the Guardians of the Galaxy series. And without any pesky, annoying Earthlings (ahem, Midgardians) hanging around to clog up the proceedings it's got more Marvel references and easter eggs per frame than any of its predecessors. </p>

            <p>Thor: Ragnarok is a feast for Marvel fans, and it will probably take me a second viewing to catch everything in it, simply because in nearly every scene there's a design, a piece of architecture, or a background character who positively must have come from the comics page. So with the full understanding that I definitely missed something (or a few something), it's up to you, dear readers, to help me out. Spot something I didn't? Shout it out in the comments, or give me a holler on Twitter. If it checks out, I'll update this!</p>
              
            <h2 class="section-heading">What is Ragnarok?</h2>

            <p>- Ragnarok, of course, is the Norse "twilight of the gods." Key points of the mythological Ragnarok that are explored here include the death of Odin and Thor losing an eye (although he usually has to do that to himself in order to gain knowledge, but we'll take the badass fight instead for cinematic purposes).</p>

            <p>Marvel has touched on Ragnarok more than once in the comics, most notably in stories by Walt Simonson (whose influence is all over this movie) and more recently by Michael Avon Oeming and Andrea Di Vitto. It was in the latter that we see a couple of small elements in this movie, notably the shattering of Thor's hammer, the death of the Warriors Three, and Surtur's prominence.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">The Villains</h2>

            <p>The first villain we meet in the movie is Surtur, and fans of Walt Simonson's take on Thor will be excited. While the character has been around since the Lee/Kirby days, it's really the Simonson stuff that made the character pop on the comics page, and the visual we get here is more in line with his vision.</p>

            <p>- Surtur ends up kind of manifesting a giant snake, and I wonder if this is supposed to represent the Midgard Serpent, disturbance of which is another harbinger of the mythological Ragnarok.</p>

           
            <p>Helaâ€™s origin is different from both her comic and mythological versions. It's way too much to get into here, but we have a whole article about her comic origins for you.</p>
              
            <p>- Her cinematic origins have a lot less in common with her comics counterpart than they do with Angela. Angela is...hoo boy...she's the lost daughter of Odin and Frigga killed in a secret war with the later hidden tenth realm, "heven." She was raised by the angels in the tenth realm after it was sealed off by Odin as punishment for their rebellion. She first appeared in the comics version of Age of Ultron and was revealed as Thor and Loki's sister in Original Sin. She's currently living out her best life, having conquered Hel to free the trapped soul of her girlfriend, then abdicating the throne.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Thor: Ragnarok - The Planet Hulk Connection</h2>

            <p>- So, Sakaar is, literally the "Planet Hulk" of the comics. Not that it's a planet full of Hulks or anything, but that is indeed where it all takes place. In the comics, though, Hulk didn't accidentally end up hurtling off into space, he was actually sent their by Tony Stark and Reed Richards because he's such a menace. It...it didn't end well for anyone involved.</p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/thor-ragnarok-2560x1440-4k-8k-2017-9692.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
           

            <p>But Hulk did indeed end up as a Gladiator on Sakaar (it had nothing to do with the Grandmaster). However, he didn't fight Thor in the arena...he fought the Silver Surfer! But since the Surfer is sadly unavailable for Marvel Studios (which is a damn shame...can you imagine what they could do with this character?) they swapped him out for Thor. This fight ALMOST happened in the animated adaptation of Planet Hulk, except there it was the Beta Ray Bill version of Thor in the arena with Hulk.</p>

            <p>I'll be updating this throughout opening weekend, especially as I get more out of a second viewing. But in the meantime, if you've spotted something I missed, help us out in the comments or hit me up on Twitter!</p>
